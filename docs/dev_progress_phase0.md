  - Proper workspace dependencies and configurations

  ðŸ§ª Test Results

  - Types Package: 5/5 tests passing
  - Mock Package: 9/9 tests passing
  - Utils Package: 12/12 tests passing
  - Backend: 1/1 tests passing
  - Total: 27/27 tests passing âœ…

  ðŸ“± Ready for Development

  The foundation is now complete and ready for the 4-person team to begin Phase 1 parallel development:
  - FE1 (Charts/Viz): Can implement Recharts components with real data
  - FE2 (UI/Layout): Can build layouts with working mock data
  - BE1 (Financial Data): Can integrate real APIs with existing structure
  - BE2 (News/AI): Can add Claude API integration to existing services

  ðŸ”§ Available Commands

  npm run dev           # Start all development servers
  npm run dev:mobile    # Start mobile app only
  npm run dev:web       # Start web app only  
  npm run dev:backend   # Start backend only
  npm run test          # Run all tests
  npm run typecheck     # Type check all packages

  The "Vibe Coding" approach is now enabled - all developers can work in parallel from day one with a solid, tested foundation that compiles everywhere and provides immediate
  visual feedback through working applications.
